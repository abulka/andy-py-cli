Example test Python CLI app for the Ubuntu app store

A simple Python program that prints a few messages, 
lists the contents of the current directory and makes an internet GET request. 

It's a CLI app not a GUI app, thus is much simpler to build, and you install and run it in the Linux terminal.

See my medium article for instructions and more context.
